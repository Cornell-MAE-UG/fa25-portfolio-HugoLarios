## About Me

My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying mechanical and aerospace engineering. (Add more info later)

My dream is to improve my technical skills and be able to design and build some crazy cool things!

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
